# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I am currently working in the gambling industry, but I'm looking for new challenges as a **Full-Stack Developer** and **Frontend Developer**. I'm passionate about building scalable applications and always eager to work on exciting projects that challenge me to grow and expand my skill set! 💻🚀

🚀 Right now, I'm working on an exciting side project called **[Bachelor Drone](https://github.com/maciek30-byte/Bachelor-Drone-Project)**. This project, which is publicly available in the **Projects** section, involves developing an AI-driven drone management system. The goal is to explore the world of AI agents, integrate them with autonomous drone control, and simulate scenarios such as monitoring, security, and event management. As an **AI enthusiast**, this project is the perfect playground for me to combine my technical skills with my passion for AI and drones. 🛸🤖

🚀 You can check out the **project RoadMap**, the **current status indicator** 🟢, and keep track of all the progress. **Contributors** are, unfortunately, **not welcome for now** (Bachelor requirements 😔), but **feedback**, **suggestions**, and **code reviews** are more than welcome! 💬🛠️

With **Bachelor Drone**, I’m experimenting with everything from mission planning to AI decision-making, using drones to patrol and react to various events. It's a hands-on way for me to expand my knowledge in AI and have some fun with technology at the same time!
